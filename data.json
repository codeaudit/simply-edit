This editor uses the markup provided in the HTML to merge the page with the data, clientside. In this example, the page data is also&nbsp;stored in GitHub.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Not just Markdown</h3>\n\n<p>While Markdown is fine for most uses, this editor allows you to fully leverage the power of HTML. By using &lt;template&gt; instructions within the HTML, the&nbsp;editor can insert any HTML structure you want. Modifications on the page are quick and simple, leaving you in control. Take a peek at the <a href=\"integration.html\">quick integration guide</a> for more information, or check out the <a href=\"/sublime/\">Sublime template</a>&nbsp;or the <a href=\"http://ylebre.github.io/spectral/\">Spectral template</a>.</p>\n\n\n<h3>Plays well with others</h3>\n\n<p>This editor was designed with an expanding web in mind. The toolbars in the pages are context-aware and are easily added to the editor to add specific options for specific HTML structures. The basic version supports the&nbsp;most&nbsp;commonly used HTML elements (text, images, hyperlinks), but more toolbars are available. Each editor context&nbsp;uses CSS-like selectors to decide which toolbar is best suited.&nbsp;Read more about <a href=\"adding-toolbars.html\">adding toolbars</a>. </p>\n\n\n<h3>CMS&nbsp;Integrations</h3>\n\n<p>We are looking for developers that want to help us integrate Simply edit into various platforms. We have integrated the editor in <a href=\"http://www.ariadne-cms.org/\">Ariadne</a>,&nbsp;our own&nbsp;web application platform, but the world of the web is a much larger place. Since the editor is now totally decoupled from Ariadne, we want to share it with as many users as possible.</p>\n\n\n<h3>\n<a id=\"support-or-contact\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"#support-or-contact\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a><span class=\"octicon octicon-link\"></span>Support or Contact</h3>\n\n<p>Having trouble with the editor?&nbsp;Have an idea for a 'must have'&nbsp;plugin?
